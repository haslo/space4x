# :checkered_flag: Design Goals

A game that...

* ...is epic in scope like TI3
* ...has a deeper trade aspect and more planet economy simulation than TI3
* ...has diplomatic ways to interact with other cultures like Empires of the Void
* ...is less forgettable than Empires of the Void
* ...has an equal amount of ship customization to Eclipse
* ...doesn't have any of the downsides that annoy me in Eclipse (notably, "researching away" and last-turn optimization)
* ...has economic, diplomatic and military aspects like Hegemony
* ...is much less abstracted than Hegemony
* ...should be playable in 3-5 hours with something like 2-4 players
* ...has influence spheres that impact the ways planets can be governed
* ...can actually be produced
* ...is well-balanced in terms of victory chances for the different influence spheres
* ...has a solo mode baked in without major rules changes
* ...doesn't allow a player to focus on all aspects simultaneously
