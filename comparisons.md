# :love_letter: Comparisons

## Other Space 4X-ish Games & Inspirations

### Space Empires 4X

* superb combat
* great implementation of fog of war
* best space combat game I know, one of my favorite games ever
* awesome solo mode
* no trade
* no resource management
* no friendly encounters with other players

### Twilight Imperium

* awesome space opera
* interesting research tree
* interesting races
* abstracted trade
* abstracted production
* centralized politics
* still a huge game (makes me scared of this project)
* never played 4rd Edition, only 3rd ~12 times

### Eclipse

* great and inspiring ship customization options
* awesome economy mechanisms
* varied and interesting racial abilities
* annoying exploration (where you choose what is in space)
* annoying research (where others can research away your wished-for tech)
* annoying end-of-game procedure (pure VP maximization in the last turn)
* odd space (with limited movement)

### Empires of the Void

* good tech trees
* great Euro mechanisms
* diplomacy vs attacking mechanisms for earning / taking over planets
* interesting alien ships (with planets)
* neat planet abilities
* never played version II

### Hegemonic

* influence spheres - military, diplomacy, economics
* rather abstract, but relatively fast-playing
* the main inspiration for this game, though altogether different
* never played before starting design here

### Brass / Agricola / Caverna / Le Havre

* engine building / resource processing role models
* Brass = production and transportation inspiration
* never played Brass / Le Havre before starting design here
