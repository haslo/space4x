# Influence Spheres

* Military
* Diplomacy
* Economics

    * get one for free at start of game
    * no building unless for replacing original one
    * can move
  * Scouts
    * can build from the start
    * can move
  * Cruisers
    * can only build with ship size 2
    * can move
  * Dreadnoughts
    * can only build with ship size 3
    * can move
  * Ground Bases
    * can build from the start
    * cannot move
  * Orbital Stations
    * can only build with ship size 2
    * cannot move
* Diplomacy:
  * Embassies
    * can build from the start
    * cannot move
  * Secret Agents
    * can only build in embassies
    * can move, secret location tracking
  * Counter Espionage Agents

    * cannot move
  * Government Buildings
    * can build from the start
    * only one government building per planet
    * cannot move

    * can build from the start
    * cannot move
  * Terraforming Stations
    * requires terraforming technology
    * can only build on non-terraformed planets
    * cannot move
    * terraform for 2 rounds, then the planet is habitable and terraforming station gone
