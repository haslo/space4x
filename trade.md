# :moneybag: Trade

## Costs of Production

* own factories, every step (extraction / composition) costs 1
  * track number of activations
  * when max is reached no more activations are possible (by any player), is reset at end of round only
  * thus see :cyclone: [Round Structure](https://github.com/haslo/space4x/blob/master/round_structure.md)
* own transports / smuggling routes are free
  * track number of activations for any trade ship
  * trade ship can be used as many times as it has cargo holds (2x with Improved Cargo Holds)
  * when max is reached no more activations are possible (by any player), is reset at end of round only
  * smuggling routes only usable by owner, work like transport routes otherwise (Improved Cargo Holds irrelevant)
* foreign factories, every step (extraction / composition) costs 2, 1 of which goes to owner
  * track number of activations, see above
  * factories only usable when both players agree or smuggling route is used
* foreign transports cost 1 (per involved player in route, not per ship), goes to owner
  * track number of activations, see above
  * transports only usable when both players agree
* Trade Posts provide all naturally occurring materials for 3 (vs. 2 for trader player, 1 for selfmade), composites for 10 (vs. 7 for trader player, 3 for selfmade)
* Every time a player buys from another player, give IOU token
