## Coexistence in Hexes

### Civil Units / Buildings, Military Buildings

#### Not at War

Civil units and buildings from different players coexist freely, with both other player's civil and military units and buildings.

#### At War

* Even at war, civil units and buildings as well as military buildings will peacefully coexist as long as no military units are present
* Civil units and buildings as well as military buildings that are not supported by friendly military units not engaged in battle are immediately destroyed when enemy military units (at war) are in their hex
* Trade ships emplaced next to a hex with enemy military units not engaged in battle immediately have to retreat to the other hex of the hex edge they are emplaced on

### Military Units

Military units by different players can also coexist in hexes, as long as the players they belong to are not at war. If they are at war, a battle immediately ensues. If two players with coexisting military units start a war, immediately resolve all corresponding combats (see [Combat](https://github.com/haslo/space4x/blob/master/combat.md)).
