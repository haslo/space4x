# :trophy: Victory Conditions

## Missions

This game does not use Victory Points.

An idea: Instead, it presents the players with missions (one mission for each influence sphere?). Players are free to pursue whatever missions they like. Achieving a mission wins them the game immediately.

Another idea: Missions are similar to the ones in Archipelaga, with a game end condition as well as VP conditions on every secret card. Players would draw a number of mission cards (martial, diplomatic, economic) - for example, draw 3 ("I'll take two economic one martial"), and then they choose one of those secretly. Archipelago additionally has one public card that gives VP to everybody.
